# DeveloperTask281217
Target: Design and implement a program which will handle and manage a "File System" structure.

The file system contains the following entities and operations:

A File is defined as having:  
A name - up to 32 characters long  
A size - positive long integer  
A create date (date type)  

A directory is defined as having:  
A name - up to 32 characters long  
A create date (date type)  
A directory can contain directories or files  


The program will include the following functionalities:

addFile (string parentDirName, String fileName, integer fileSize)  
Adds new File under the Directory branch

addDir (string parentDirName, String dirName)  
Adds new Directory under the parent Directory
 
delete (string name)  
Deletes the Directory or the File with this name

showFileSystem ()  
Displays all files & directories with their hierarchical structure (for file display all file properties and for Directory all its properties)  


Each name, file or directory is unique in the file system  
Each directory can contain an unlimited number of files or directories  
No need to write anything on the disk - the data structure should be managed in memory only  


The design should include:  
The classes that will be involved in the program and the relationship between them  
The major methods and members of each class
